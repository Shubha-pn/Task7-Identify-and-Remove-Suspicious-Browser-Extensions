## Task 7: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions (Firefox)

## Objective
The goal of this task is to explore browser extensions, understand their functions, identify potentially harmful ones, and remove or manage them to improve browser security.

## What Are Browser Extensions?
A Browser extension is a small software add-on installed in a web browser to add extra features or customize the browsing experience.

They are used to:
  * Block ads
  * Manage passwords
  * Enhance productivity
  * Customize website appearance
  * Translate languages
  * Analyze websites, and more

## Why Do We Use Extensions?
Browser extensions can:
  * Save time
  * Improve functionality 
  * Help in research and security 
  * Enhance privacy
    
## Security Concerns of Extensions
Although helpful, extensions can pose serious security risks such as:
  * Data theft : Access to browsing history, passwords, cookies.
  * Malware : Injecting malicious scripts into web pages.
  * Tracking : Monitoring online activities without consent.
  * Phishing : Redirecting users to fake login pages.

That’s why it’s important to:
  * Install extensions only from **trusted sources**
  * Regularly review **permissions**
  * **Remove** extensions that are not being used
